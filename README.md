# py_func_fitting
This is a one-dimensional data fitting algorithm, which can be used when you want to fit a curve with a function but the function expression is unknown. This program is written in python3.

Before using this program, make sure you have install SciPy v1.1.0.

And there is something you need to change in from scipy.optimize.curve_fit. Because I add a new return function of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
